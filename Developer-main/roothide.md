# The difference between roothide and rootless

1. ***/var/jb***

   roothide is also root-less, but it no longer installs the jailbreak to the fixed path of /var/jb,
   
   it (re)installs the jailbreak to a directory(named jbroot) with a random name each time we jailbreak.

2. ***About link and load path***

   compared with rootless using /var/jb to link all dependent libraries, roothide uses the dyld variable "@loader_path" to link dependent libraries.

   all dependent libraries should set install_name to @loader_path/.jbroot/absolute_path_to_lib, for example:

   ```@loader_path/.jbroot/usr/lib/libsubstrate.dylib```

   ```@loader_path/.jbroot/Library/Frameworks/Cephei.framework/Cephei```

   in this way we can directly use the more accurate absolute path of the library to link.

   each directory containing a mach-o file will automatically generate a .jbroot symbolic link that pointing to the jailbreak root directory,
   it's usually generated by dpkg when installing packages, or generated by the jailbreak itself when loading a binary/library,
   and roothide will automatically remove the related .jbroot symbolic link to keep system clean when dpkg removes a package.

4. ***Access jailbreak files in code of jailbreak app/daemon/tweak***

   roothide provides a [uniquely named API](interface.md) to get the root directory path of the current jailbreak, this API can be used anywhere in c/c++/objc/swift, and theos will automatically make it an empty stub via a macro when you compiling for rootful/rootless.

5. ***Interact with bootstrap***

   most of the libraries and command line tools automatically installed during jailbreak are bootstrap from procursus,
   and procursus also provides a large number of useful packages, such as rm/cp/mv/chmod/chown/ldid/ssh/uicache...

   unlike rootless uses the original root file system (rootfs) of iOS as the default root,
   roothide's bootstrap uses jbroot as the default root, and roothide creates a symbolic link named "rootfs" in jbroot to provide bootstrap access to the iOS original root file system. (see [vroot](vroot.md)).

   this means that all command line tools in bootstrap will only accept jbroot-based paths, and will only output jbroot-based paths. (and you should also use this path rule in jailbreak plist/config/shell-script files).

   show case:

   ```
   # operate files in jbroot
   cp /var/config.plist /etc/config.plist
   ```

   ```
   # copy file from rootfs to jbroot
   cp /rootfs/var/config.plist /etc/config.plist
   ```

   ```
   # copy file from jbroot to rootfs 
   cp /etc/config.plist /rootfs/var/config.plist
   ```
   
   ```
   # operate files in rootfs 
   cp /rootfs/etc/config.plist /rootfs/var/config.plist
   ```

   roothide also provides command line tools called jbroot and rootfs to get/convert paths in shell/scripts in some specific cases.


## Final

roothide is designed to be kept as simple as possible to provide sustainability and maintainability.
